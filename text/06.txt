before we get to the 90 degree deodorant speech recognition in Python let's take a moment to talk about how speech recognition works
a full discussion with Philip book so I won't bore you with all of the technical details here
it sucked this section is not a prerequisite to the rest of the tutorial
if you'd like to go straight to the point then through Freight skip ahead
speech recognition has its roots in research that I buy Alive's in the early 1950s
early systems were limited to a single speaker and have limited vocabulary is about a doesn't work
motor speech recognition systems have come a long way since their Asian counterparts
they can recognize speech from multiple speakers and have enormous vocabularies in numerous languages
the first component of speech recognition is of course speech speech must be converted from physical sound to electrical signal with the microphone and then to Digital Data with a analog to digital converter
was digitized several models can be used to transcribe the audio to text
most modern speech recognition systems rely on what is known as a Highland Mark of model
this approach works on the assumption that is Speed Stick know when viewed on a short enough time scale can be reasonably approximated as a stationary process that is a process in which statistical properties do not change over time
in a typical height and Markov model the Speed Stick no is divided into 10 millisecond fragments
the power spectrum of each fragment which is essentially a plot of the signals power as a function of a frequency is mapped to a vector of the real numbers known as cap stroke patients
the dimension of this factor is your dismal sometimes as low as 10 although more accurate systems may have to measure 32 or more
the final output of the height of Marco model is a sequence of these factors
2D code to speech into text groups of letters are matched to one or more phonemes a fundamental unit of speech
this calculation requires training since the sound of a phoneme varies from speaker to speaker and even berries from Juarez to another by the same speaker
a special algorithm apply to determine the most likely worse that produced the deepest secrets of the phonemes
one can imagine that this whole process maybe computation way expensive
American modern speech recognition systems neural networks are used to simplify the speech signal using techniques for feature transformation and dimensionality reduction before hide and Market model recognition
voice activity detectors are also used to reduce an audio signal to only the Porsches that are likely to contain speech
this provides the recognizer from wasting time analyzing unnecessary parts of the signal
fortunately as a python programmer you don't have to worry about any of this
number of speech recognition services are available for use online through an API and Manuel de services offer python SD case
