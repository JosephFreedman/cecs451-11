before we get to the nitty-gritty of do speech recognition in Python let's take a moment to talk about how speech recognition works
a full discussion with Philip books I won't bore you with all the technical details here
in fact the section is not prerequisite to the rest of the tutorial
if you'd like to get straight to the point then feel free to skip ahead
speech recognition has its roots in research done at Bell labs in the early 1950s
early systems are limited to a single speaker and had limited vocabulary about a thousand words
modern speech recognition systems have come a long way since their ancient counterparts
they can recognize speech from multiple speakers and have an enormous vocabularies and numerous languages
the first component of speech recognition is a course speech speech must be converted from physical sound to an electrical signal with a microphone and then to Digital Data with an analog to digital converter
once digitized several models can be used to transcribe the audio to text
most modern speech recognition systems rely on what is known as a hidden Markov model
This Modern approach works on the assumption that a speech signal when viewed on a short enough time scale can be reasonably approximated as a stationary process that is a process in which statistical properties do not change over time
in a typical hidden Markov model the speech signal is divided into 10 millisecond fragments
the power spectrum of each fragment which is essentially a plot of the signals power as a function of frequency is mapped to a vector of real numbers known as capstraw coefficients
the dimension of this Vector is usually small sometimes as low as 10 although more accurate systems may have Dimension 32 or more
the final output of the Hidden Markov model is a sequence of these vectors
to decode the speech into text groups are vectors are matched to one or more phonemes a fundamental unit of speech
this calculation requires training
special algorithm
one can imagine that the whole process may be computationally expensive
many modern speech recognition system
voice activity detectors are also used to reduce an audio signal to clean the portions that are likely to be the same speed
this prevents the recognizer from wasting time analyzing unnecessary parts of the signal
fortunately as a python programmer you don't have to worry about any of this
the number of speech recognition services are available for use online through an API services offer python sdks
