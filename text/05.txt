before we get to the nitty-gritty of doing speech recognition in Python let's take a moment to talk about how speech recognition works
a full discussion would fill a book so I won't bore you with all the technical details here
in fact the section is not prerequisite to the rest of the tutorial
if you'd like to get straight to the point then feel free to skip ahead
speech recognition has its roots in research done at Bell labs in the early 1950s
early systems were limited to a single speaker and have them added vocabulary of about a dozen words
modern speech recognition systems have come a long way since their ancient counterparts
they can recognize speech from multiple speakers and have enormous vocabularies in numerous languages
the first component of speech recognition is ofcourse speech speech must be converted from physical sound to an electrical signal with the microphone and then to Digital Data with an analog to digital converter
once digitized several models can be used to transcribe the audio to text
most modern speech recognition systems rely on what is known as a hidden Markov model
this approach worked on the assumption that a speech signal when viewed on a short enough time scale can be reasonably approximated as a stationary process that is a process in which statistical properties do not change over time
typical hidden Markov model the speech signal is divided into 10 millisecond fragments
the power spectrum of each fragment which is essentially a plot of the signals power as a function of frequency is map to a vector of real numbers known as cepstral coefficients
the dimension of this Vector is usually small sometimes as low as 10 adult more accurate systems may have Dimension 32 or more
the final output of the Hidden Markov model is a sequence of these vectors
to decode the speech into text groups of vectors or match to one of more phonemes a fundamental unit of speech
this calculation requires training since the sound of a Phenom varies from speaker to speaker and even varies from one other errands to another by the same speaker
a special algorithm is done applied to determine the most likely words that produce the given sequence of phenoms
one can imagine that this whole process may be computationally expensive
in many modern speech recognition systems neural networks are used to simplify the speech signal using techniques for feature transformation and dimensionality reduction before hidden Markov model recognition
voice activity detectors are also used to reduce an audio signal to only the portions that are likely to contain speech
this prevents the recognizer from wasting time analyzing unnecessary parts of the signal
fortunately as a python programmer you don't have to worry about any of this
a number of speech recognition services are available for use online through an API and many of these services offer python SDK
